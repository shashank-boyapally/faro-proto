The Arcalot community develops tools, plugins, and libraries that you can use either standalone as a library, and/or via a user interface or CLI. You can run the tools locally, remotely, or as part of a bigger system. Arcalot:

* Helps you create workflows with **normalized input and output schemas**
* Provides you with **assisted and automated root cause analysis** for the workflows you create as well as CI and other log systems
* Provides **stable plugins for several workloads**

Arcaflow is a workflow engine consisting of three main components:

* Core engine
* UI
* Plugins (including SDKs for Go and Python to write your own plugins)

It allows you to click and drag plugins into a workflow for your systems and, if needed, feed the resulting data back into the UI for further analysis. You can also use it just to generate a workflow with parallel and subsequent tasks via the command line. There is a range of supported plugins, written either in Go or Python.

Arcalog can assist you with or automate your root cause analysis in CI or other log systems either as a standalone tool or by embedding it into your applications.

It also provides additional tooling to download jobs from various log systems or add your own log files for analysis.
