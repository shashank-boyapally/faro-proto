# openshift-psap
OpenShift Performance-Sensitive Application Platform Artifacts

* Master is the latest version of OpenShift (possibly not publicly released yet).  Each public release will have a branch.  Make sure to use the branch corresponding to the version of OpenShift that you're running.

```git clone -b ocp39 https://github.com/redhat-performance/openshift-psap```

* Edit the inventory/inventory.example and replace the master and fast_nodes with node names in your cluster.

## Ansible Roles

### nvidia-driver-install
This role will pull down the latest 3rd party NVIDIA driver and install it.
After editing the inventory file, run:
```ansible-playbook -i ./inventory/inventory -e hosts_to_apply="fast_nodes" ./playbooks/nvidia-driver-install.yaml```
where `fast_nodes` is the Ansible inventory groupname for your nodes with GPUs

### nvidia-container-runtime-hook
This playbook will install the nvidia-container-runtime-hook which is used to
mount libraries from the host into a pod whose dockerfile has certain
environment variables. It is invoked as the `nvidia-driver-install` playbook above.

### nvidia-device-plugin
This playbook will deploy the NVIDIA device-plugin daemonset, which allows you to schedule GPU pods. 
```ansible-playbook -i ./inventory/inventory -e hosts_to_apply="master_hostname" -e gpu_hosts="fast_nodes" ./playbooks/nvidia-driver-install.yaml```

`master_hostname` is the inventory hostname of one of your masters. `fast_nodes` is the inventory groupname for your nodes with GPUs.

After deploying, run:
```oc describe node x.x.x.x | grep -A15 Capacity```.  You should see nvidia.com/gpu=N where N is the number of GPUs in the system.

### gpu-pod
This role will create a new pod that leverages Taints and Tolerations to run on the fastnode pool.  It consumes a GPU.  The pod sleeps indefinitely.  To test your GPU pod:
Also included is a basic Dockerfile that is based on the NVIDIA CUDA 9.1 CentOS7 image and includes the deviceQuery binary used below.

Run the deviceQuery command.  This demonstrates that the process in the pod has access to the GPU hardware.  If it did not, the Result at the bottom would indicate FAIL.
```
# oc rsh gpu-pod /usr/local/cuda-9.1/samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery/deviceQuery

```

The gpu-pod role also includes a caffe2 Multi-GPU jupyter notebook demo.  Deploy the caffe2 environment like so:

```ansible-playbook -i inventory/inv playbooks/gpu-pod.yaml```

To access the jupyter webserver run the ```get_url.sh`` script on the master.

```
playbooks/gpu-pod/get_url.sh
```

get_url.sh will output a route and token.

Use the token to authenticate to route:
http://<route>/notebooks/caffe2/caffe2/python/tutorials/Multi-GPU_Training.ipynb?token=<token>

### tuned-setup
This role will demonstrate use of the tuned tuning profile delivery mechanism to partition your node into two sections; housekeeping and isolated cores.  These cores are de-jittered (as much as possible) from kernel activity and will not run userspace threads unless those threads have their affinity explicitly defined.

The ansible inventory includes several variables use to configure tuned:

* ```isolated_cores``` the list of cores to be de-jittered.
* ```nr_hugepages``` the number of 2Mi hugepages to be allocated.

### tandt-setup
This role will demonstrate use of Taints and Tolerations to carve out a "node pool" called fastnode.  Pods without matching tolerations will not be scheduled to this isolated pool.

### node-feature-discovery-setup
This role will demonstrate the use of the node-feature-discovery Kubernetes Incubator project to discovery hardware characteristics (such as CPU capabilities) on the node.  node-feature-discovery then labels the nodes for use in scheduling decisions.  This role deploys NFD as a daemonset.  For more information about NFD, see the following [link](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/node-feature-discovery)

Here is what the daemonset looks like when deployed:

```
# oc get ds -n node-feature-discovery
NAME                     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE
node-feature-discovery   3         3         3         3            3           <none>          5m
```
```
And here are the labels that NFD has added to each node:

```

### cpumanager-hugepages
This role will creates a pod that runs on the de-jittered cores created by the tuned profile.

* It uses taints and tolerations to steer the pods towards a node in the fastnode pool.
* It enables the CPUManager feature gate in the kubelet.
* It enables the HugePages feature gate in the kubelet and the apiserver.
* It deploys a pod that consumes 2 exclusive cores, 2GB of regular memory and (100) 2Mi HugePages.
* It then runs map_hugetlb application to actually consume the HugePages.

### sysctl
This role will create a pod that uses both safe and unsafe sysctls.  Unsafe sysctls are those known to not be namespaced in the kernel, thus their usage in containerized environments may affect other containers on the same host.

* It uses taints and toleration to steer the pods towards a node in the fastnode pool.
* "Safe" sysctls are enabled by default.
* "Unsafe" sysctls are enabled by enabling experimental unsafe-sysctls support in the kubelet.
* It launches a pod that changes both safe and unsafe sysctls and verifies that those values were updated correctly.

```
# oc exec -it sysctl-pod sysctl kernel.shm_rmid_forced net.core.somaxconn kernel.shmmni
kernel.shm_rmid_forced = 1 # This sysctl is in the "safe" whitelist.  default is 0.
net.core.somaxconn = 10000 # This sysctl (all of net.*) is in the "unsafe" list.  default is 128.
kernel.shmmni = 8192 # This sysctl is also in the "unsafe" list.  default is 4096.
```
