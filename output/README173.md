## Prerequisites

- CentOS 8 or RHEL 8 host
- File system that supports d_type
- Ideally on a bare metal host with at least 64G of RAM.
- Run as a user with password-less `sudo` access or be ready to enter `sudo` password for prepare phase.
- Get a valid pull secret (JSON string) from [redhat.com](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret) if you want to test the installation (not needed for testing only the discovery flow). Export it as

```bash
export PULL_SECRET='<pull secret JSON>'
```

## Instructions

### Host preparation

On the bare metal host:

```bash
dnf install -y git make
cd /home/test # don't do it on /root it will breaks build image mounts and fail to run
git clone https://github.com/openshift/assisted-test-infra.git
```

When using this infra for the first time on a host, run:

```bash
make create_full_environment
```

This will install required packages, configure libvirt, pull relevant Docker images, and start Minikube.

## Usage

There are different options to use test-infra, which can be found in the makefile.

## Full flow cases

The following is a list of stages that will be run:

1. Start Minikube if not started yet
1. Deploy services for assisted deployment on Minikube
1. Create cluster in `assisted-service` service
1. Download ISO image
1. Spawn required number of VMs from downloaded ISO with parameters that can be configured by OS environment (check makefile)
1. Wait until nodes are up and registered in `assisted-service`
1. Set nodes roles in `assisted-service` by matching VM names (worker/master)
1. Verify all nodes have required hardware to start installation
1. Install nodes
1. Download `kubeconfig-noingress` to build/kubeconfig
1. Waiting till nodes are in `installed` state, while verifying that they don't move to `error` state
1. Verifying cluster is in state `installed`
1. Download kubeconfig to build/kubeconfig

**Note**: Please make sure no previous cluster is running before running a new one (it will rewrite its build files).

### Run full flow with install

To run the full flow, including installation:

```bash
make run_full_flow_with_install
```

Or to run it together with create_full_environment (requires `sudo` password):

```bash
make all
```

### Run full flow without install

To run the flow without the installation stage:

```bash
make run_full_flow
```

### Run only deploy nodes (without pre deploy of all assisted service)

```bash
make deploy_nodes or make deploy_nodes_with_install
```

### Redeploy nodes

```bash
make redeploy_nodes or make redeploy_nodes_with_install
```

### Redeploy with assisted services

```bash
make redeploy_all or make redeploy_all_with_install
```

### Cleaning

Following sections show how to perform cleaning of test-infra environment.

#### Clean all include minikube

```bash
make destroy
```

#### Clean nodes only

```bash
make destroy_nodes
```

#### Delete all virsh resources

Sometimes you may need to delete all libvirt resources

```bash
make delete_all_virsh_resources
```

### Install cluster

Install cluster after nodes were deployed. Can take ClusterId as OS environment

```bash
make install_cluster
```

### Create cluster and download ISO

```bash
make download_iso
```

### Deploy Assisted Service and Monitoring stack

```bash
make run
make deploy_monitoring
```

### `deploy_assisted_service` and Create cluster and download ISO

```bash
make download_iso_for_remote_use
```

### start_minikube and Deploy UI and open port forwarding on port 6008, allows to connect to it from browser

```bash
make deploy_ui
```

### Kill all open port forwarding commands, will be part of destroy target

```bash
make kill_all_port_forwardings
```

## Test `assisted-service` image

```bash
make redeploy_all SERVICE=<image to test>
or
export PULL_SECRET='<pull secret JSON>'; make redeploy_all_with_install SERVICE=<image to test>
```

### Test agent image

```bash
make redeploy_all AGENT_DOCKER_IMAGE=<image to test>
or
make redeploy_all_with_install AGENT_DOCKER_IMAGE=<image to test>
```

### Test installer image or controller image

```bash
make redeploy_all INSTALLER_IMAGE=<image to test> CONTROLLER_IMAGE=<image to test>
or
export PULL_SECRET='<pull secret JSON>'; make redeploy_all_with_install INSTALLER_IMAGE=<image to test> CONTROLLER_IMAGE=<image to test>
```

## Test installer, controller, `assisted-service` and agent images in the same flow

```bash
make redeploy_all INSTALLER_IMAGE=<image to test> AGENT_DOCKER_IMAGE=<image to test> SERVICE=<image to test>
or
export PULL_SECRET='<pull secret JSON>'; make redeploy_all_with_install INSTALLER_IMAGE=<image to test> CONTROLLER_IMAGE=<image to test> AGENT_DOCKER_IMAGE=<image to test> SERVICE=<image to test>
```

### Test infra image

Assisted-test-infra builds an image including all the prerequisites to handle this repository.

```bash
make image_build
```

# In case you would like to build the image with a different `assisted-service` client

```bash
make image_build SERVICE=<assisted service image URL>
```
