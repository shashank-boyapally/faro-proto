# Arcalot Code of Conduct

We care about our code *and* our community. With your contribution to this project, you agree to adhere to the Arcalot Code of Conduct and follow these four simple rules:

1. **Be nice to each other.**
2. **Assume good intentions.**
3. **Question the idea, not the person.**
4. **Take politics and off-topic discussions elsewhere.**

It can sometimes happen that our words are misunderstood. However, we do neither tolerate nor accept rude behavior of any kind in our community. Arcalot maintainers have the right to remove or edit any contributions from this project should they find that they are violating our code of conduct. Repeat or severe offenders may also be permanently banned from having a space in the community.
