# Arcalog: Assisted Root Cause Analysis for Your Logs

Arcalog is still in early development. A scientific paper describing the project is available as a [preprint](https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/Arcalog_Enhancing_Continuous_Integration_Systems_with_Assisted_Root_Cause_Analysis/20689594).

The [README](https://github.com/arcalot/arcalog/blob/main/README.md) contains a guide on how to use Arcalog to gather data as well as how to use the `--http` flag to run a minimal user interface for downloading individual build IDs from Prow.

[Pre-release developer documentation](https://arcalot.io/doc.log.arcalot.io/) is also available if you want to use the early pre-release version of Arcalog to embed the data gathering steps into your own application.
