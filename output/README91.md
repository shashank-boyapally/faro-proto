# OpenShift Files

This folder contains files used for launching the FFTW multidimensional cosine app in OpenShift on AWS. To run, first make sure you've set up an OpenShift AWS instance and exposed your image registry (Docker, CRI-O, etc.). Then run:

```
$ sh run_me.sh -v <rhel_version>
```

e.g.,

```
$ sh run_me.sh -v 7
```

The above command will load the templates from the `templates` folder into your OpenShift AWS instance, create a build image special for the OpenBLAS code in this repo, and run the gemm app.

By default, your OpenShift image will be named `fftw-rhel7` and will be saved to your exposed OpenShift image registry. (NOTE: You don't need to tell the `run_me.sh` script the link to your registry since the script automatically determines the link for you. However, if you have *multiple* registries for whatever reason, you may want to edit which registry to use. So, edit the `REGISTRY` variable.)

You can run `run_me.sh` multiple times if you want. It is safe to do so, as it cleans up the environment every time you want to start a new build.

Note that if you want to build using [Node Feature Discovery](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery/) make sure you have it installed prior to running one of the the following commands:

```
$ sh run_me.sh -v 7 -n -i <instance-type> [optional args]
```
or

```
$ sh run_me.sh -v 7 -n -x <avx-instruction-set-name> [optional args]
```

Using the `-n` option calls for NFD to be used when building and running the FFTW benchmark app. Replace `<instance-type>` with the AWS instance type you want to use (e.g., m4.4xlarge, m4.large, etc.), or `<avx-instruction-set-name>` with the AVX instructions you want to use (either `no_avx`, `avx`, `avx2`, or `avx512`). Note that you cannot use both an instance type and AVX instructions at the same time.

If you wish to create a MachineSet and run the pod on a node with a specific instance type, use `scripts/create_machineset.sh`.

If you'd like, there is now an option to use the CPU Manager to set number of CPUs and memory size to use when executing the benchmarks. To use CPU Manager, pass in the `-p` option and choose values for `-c` and `-m`. The `-c` option takes in an integer, and the `-m` option takes in an integer in the form of `nG`, where `n` is any integer. For example, `18G`, for 18 GB.
