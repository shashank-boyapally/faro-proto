### Schema

The files located here are used to validate schema for almost every JSON file read or written by the rickshaw project.  This project is responsible for the following schema:

- benchmark.json: Validates the benchmark config (how to run it, how to post-process the data)
- tool.json: Validates the tool config (how to run it, how to post-process the data)
- bench-metrics.json: Validates the format to log metrics
- run.json: Validates the run information
- result.json: Validates the run and result information

The following schema come from other projects and are copied to this schema directory:

- TODO: workshop.json [include version used and from what project]
- TODO: tool-params.json [include version used and from what project]
- TODO: bench-params.json [include version used and from what project]
