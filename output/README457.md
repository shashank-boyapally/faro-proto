# Arcaflow engine deployer dummy

This library is an implementation of the [arcaflow deployer interface](https://github.com/arcalot/arcaflow-engine-deployer) that mocks a real deployer.
It pretends to be a predictable deployer for use in test cases. It allows setting of things like deploy and runtime for realistic test cases.
