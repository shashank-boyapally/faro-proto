Automation wrapper for coremark_pro

Description: CoreMark®-PRO is a comprehensive, advanced processor benchmark that
    works with and enhances the market-proven industry-standard EEMBC CoreMark®
    benchmark. While CoreMark stresses the CPU pipeline, CoreMark-PRO tests the
    entire processor, adding comprehensive support for multicore technology, a
    combination of integer and floating-point workloads, and data sets for
    utilizing larger memory subsystems. Together, EEMBC CoreMark and CoreMark-PRO
    provide a standard benchmark covering the spectrum from low-end microcontrollers
    to high-performance computing processors.
