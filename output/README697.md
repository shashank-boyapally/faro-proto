# pbench-ansible-collections
Collections of roles for pbench agent and server installation

*** Obsolete ***

This repository will contain collections of roles for installing the pbench agent and the pbench server.
Currently these roles live in the [pbench repo](https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench), but they will be migrated here shortly. In addition, the repo
will contain testing code in order to allow a CI process that will build, test and upload the collections to Galaxy
on every commit.
