# Chair election on October 5th, 2022

I am leaving my position as a Chair of Arcalot, effective today. In accordance with the charter, I propose chair elections **on or shortly after the 5th of November 2022**, depending on the vote outcome of this proposal.

Arcalot Round Table members are encouraged to submit **a separate proposal** for chair nominations with a reasoned opinion on why the person nominated would make a good chair for Arcalot. As per the charter, a second member must sponsor the nomination per comment on the nomination. Arcalot Round Table members will vote on the chair proposals using pull request reviews, while **each member can only vote on one chair proposal**.

The [Arcalot Charter](https://github.com/arcalot/arcalot-round-table/blob/main/CHARTER.md#chair-elections) mandates a 6 months minimum membership for chair nominations, but the Arcalot organization is less than 6 months old, therefore this proposal is making **any Arcalot member as of the 4th of October 2022 eligible to become an Arcalot Chair** for this election only. In light of the rule change for chair voting, this proposal is open for voting using pull request reviews **until the 12th of October**.

## Benefits

* The chair elections are possible before January 29, 2023.
